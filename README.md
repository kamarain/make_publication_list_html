# make_publication_list_html

While waiting our admins to enable bibtex plugin in our WordPress site we use this script to generate the publication list at http://research.tuni.fi/publications-2

*Requires*: Linux, php, xclip

*Usage*:

1. Add new publications to one of the bibliography.bib files

2. Run:

	bash~> ./make_publications_list_html.sh

	That stores the whole html file to your clipboard.

3. Edit research.tuni.fi/vision WordPress -> Publications (generated by kamarain)
Switch to text mode. Press: CTRL-A CTRL-V (selects everything, then writes over with clipboard text)

## Store PDFs

TAU Vision Group has Webhotel where you can make personal Web pages and store static data such as publications.
You may copy your publication there, for example:

```
$ scp icpr2020_silhouette.pdf webhotel2.tuni.fi:/webpages/vision/public_data/publications/
```

and this pdf can be linked to the publications page using the url field in bibtex
